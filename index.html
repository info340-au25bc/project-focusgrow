        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
          Modern productivity and focus applications are facing a crisis of
          engagement and retention: the majority of users (<em>77-97%</em>)
          abandon these tools within days or weeks, pointing to problems like
          inflexible frameworks, lack of insightful feedback, and a disconnect
          between virtual incentivization and actual progress (<a

            target="_blank"
            >Wallace 2024</a
          >). Most timer-based solutions, such as standard Pomodoro apps,
          enforce inflexible 25-minute work blocks that can interrupt natural
          focus states and provide only basic analytics, while deeper
          motivational needs and real progress tracking are left unaddressed (<a

            target="_blank"
            >Folaron, 2024</a
          >). Although some apps attempt gamification, such as
          <a

          virtual tree-growing or
          <a href="https://habitica.com/static/home">Habitica’s</a> RPG
          features, these approaches are often seen as overly simplistic or
          overcomplicated. As a result, users keep cycling through digital tools
          that promise to build sustainable habits linked to real-world learning
          and development. This ongoing gap between perceived productivity and
          genuine growth highlights the core technological challenge modern
          developers must address.
        </p>
        <p>
          A main challenge in productivity software today is designing systems
          that combine meaningful feedback, lasting motivation, and real skill
          growth into a single, effective experience. Current products either
          visualize productivity seemingly or lack mechanisms that emotionally
          and behaviorally reinforce users’ learning goals, resulting in
          fragmented, unsatisfying experiences that fail to convert effort into
          meaningful growth (<a
            href="https://www.produce8.com/resources/how-effective-is-the-pomodoro-techniqueproduce8"
            target="_blank"
            >Chan, 2023 </a
          >). In order to move beyond temporary engagement, a new approach has
          to connect daily focus practices to visible, cumulative progress that
          reflects both performance and personal development.
          <em>FocusGrow</em> seeks to solve this by integrating focus,
          reflection, and micro-skill-building with persistent, visible virtual
          growth, addressing both the emotional and informational barriers that
          cause most users to abandon existing solutions. It attempts to turn
          productivity software from a temporary habit tracker into a true and
          genuine learning and growth system by combining a flexible system that
          supports self-driven motivation.

          We are not the only people that have seen problems with not only the basic Pomodoro method but also how 
          people are focusing when trying to study or accomplish a task. Specifically, there is an article that highlights 
          the dangers of not properly executing the Pomodoro Method (lots of people do this without realizing), 
          <a href="https://zhighley.com/article/the-danger-of-the-pomodoro-method-why-most-people-are-using-it-wrong/" target="_blank">
            Why Most People are Using it Wrong
          </a>. 
          Not only are we going to improve the implementation of the Pomodoro technique, but 
          we are also going to influence the user's dopamine when studying. It has been shown in various studies that there are 
          strong correlations between dopamine and focus when studying, as demonstrated in 
          <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/dopamine-affects-how-brain-decides-whether-goal-worth-effort" target="_blank">
            Why Dopamine affects the brain for focus tasks
          </a>. 
          With the combination of creating a game and then also implementing a proper Pomodoro Timer with proper
          focus tasks, the user will be able to study, finish tasks, and enjoy the whole process with FocusGrow.
